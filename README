I want to create an application that can easily build weekly schedules

Should save employee schedules and make it easy to adjust from week to week as needed.

Should easily be able to enter time off requests.

Will give daily and weekly hour totals for employees based on schedule. 

Will automatically account for 30 mninute lunchbreak of non-managemenet employees. 

Should make sure that there is coverage for stores when time-off requests are put in.

In future should automatically adjust for coverage based on time-off requests.


Each employee will be a class storing information about the employee
Each location will be a class storing employees who work at said location and hours

Will use javascript to build and display schedule dynamically
